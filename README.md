# My Flutter Project

## About

This is a Flutter project that serves as a starting point for a Flutter application.

## Getting Started

If this is your first Flutter project, you can get started with the following resources:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)
- For more detailed guidance, view the [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs).

## Amplify Integration

This project is integrated with AWS Amplify for backend services. You can use the following Amplify CLI commands:

- `amplify status`: Check the local configuration and deployment status.
- `amplify add <feature>`: Add features like user login or a backend API.
- `amplify push`: Build local backend resources and provision them in the cloud.
- `amplify console`: Open the Amplify Console to view project status.
- `amplify publish`: Build both local backend and frontend resources and provision them in the cloud.

For Amplify to work, ensure that you've configured your backend using the Amplify CLI.

## Project Structure

- `lib/amplifyconfiguration.dart`: This file is used by the app to reach your provisioned backend resources at runtime.
