# My Flutter Project

## About

This is a Flutter project that served as a valuable learning experience for me. Throughout this project, I had the opportunity to explore various aspects of mobile app development and integrate [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) for backend services.

You can follow these steps to create your own app; [Build a Flutter Mobile App Using AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-flutter-mobile-app-part-one/module-four/)

## Key Learnings

- **AWS Integration:** I learned how to integrate AWS services into my Flutter project using the [Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli). This allowed me to leverage powerful backend functionality for my app.

- **Module Development:** The project was divided into several modules, each with its unique challenges. I gained hands-on experience in cloning and updating a Flutter app, implementing features like displaying past trips and activities, and creating and managing user profiles.

- **Prerequisites:** Before starting this project, I ensured I had the necessary prerequisites in place, including an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install), [Flutter environment](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and a code editor. These tools were crucial for a smooth development process.

## Reflection

This project was a valuable journey in mobile app development. It allowed me to apply my knowledge and learn new skills along the way. Building features like past trip display, activity management, and user profiles enriched my understanding of app architecture and user experience.

## Tech Tools Used

Throughout this journey, I relied on:

- [**VSCode**](https://code.visualstudio.com/): As a text editor.

- **AWS Account:** Essential for cloud-based services.

- [**Amplify CLI**](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli): Simplifying AWS integration.

- [**Flutter**](https://flutter.dev/): My primary mobile app development platform.

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/): For version control and collaboration.
